# Setting up and adding it to your discord server
You can add QueueSniper to your discord server [here](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=513096941693960223&scope=bot).


Once QueueSniper is in your server run ".setup". Ensure QueueSniper has all the proper permissions required or some features will not work correctly!

# Troubleshooting and help

If the bot is not sending messages or is unable to talk in voice channels:
  - Ensure it has proper permissions (**Send Messages**, **Read Messages**, **Read Message History**)
  - Ensure it has proper voice permissions (**Connect**, **Speak**, **Use Voice Activity**, **Priority Speaker**)
  If it is still not sending messages kick and re-add the bot.
